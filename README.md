## Analysis of Human Mobility in San Diego County during COVID-19
This project showcases how human mobility in San Diego County has been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on facility closure and reopenings in the midst of new lockdowns, restrictions and spikes in infections. We analyzed cell-phone-based origin-destination trip data at the Census Block Group level in County of San Diego, CA. Places of interest within the local region, or destinations, in this study include popular attractions  (e.g., zoo, park, beach, casino). We discuss how mobility patterns to those destinations have changed before and after closure and after reopening as well as provide context to the sociodemographic characteristics of local origin places.

## Methodology
For our analysis on human mobility, we kept our scope within San Diego County, particularly San Diego County CBGs. We analyze data on a census-tract and block group level. We choose block groups for our data analysis because this is the finest available scale, right behind census blocks at which the census bureau collects data and this gives us more precise results. Specific casinos such as Viejas, Sycuan and Jamul casinos were selected as they have been linked to some of the worst local outbreaks coming from casinos. (Sharma, 2020) Outdoor POIs such as Mission Beach and Balboa Park serve as interest points due to their popularity with locals and tourists alike. Balboa Park in particular, is one of the largest and most popular attractions in San Diego, and given its numerous spots and size, would be a great POI for analysis as this area would see a difference in mobility. The lockdowns and restrictions would have greatly affected mobility going into these spots. These spots were chosen as POIs to observe if there exists any differences in mobility for popular indoor POIs versus popular outdoor POIs, as well as to observe similarities in mobility trends as a result of the government stay at home orders and reopenings.
Animated Kepler maps are utilized in this study in order to visualize the difference in mobility as a result of government stay-at-home orders and subsequent reopenings for many public spots. These Kepler maps visualize mobility from one CBG to another from January 2020 to October 2020 with a dynamic interactive interface. In this case, mobility is illustrated by the thickness of lines going from CBGs across San Diego County towards POIs, and how the visual representation of those lines change over a period of time. In addition, Kepler maps possess a Polygon feature that can outline the borders of a CBG, which can be used to highlight any differences in sociodemographic factors among all the local CBGs like percentage of specific age groups or median household income. Additionally, time series graphs can also aid in showing a general trend of mobility on a weekly basis, and can highlight any seasonal trends and can help provide context to any anomalies in the data in terms of mobility. Time series graphs in this study are created using Python libraries like Matplotlib.

Using R, correlation analysis is also done based on demographic factors in CBGs. In this study, mobility is correlated with CBG demographic factors like age and median household income. We use the age demographic for correlation with the casino inflows as it is a common belief that people that fall into a certain (generally middle-aged or older) age bracket tend to make-up the majority of casino traffic. Furthermore, the age demographic in casino traffic tends to have a higher disposable income and thus, a higher household income. Analyzing San Diego CBGs by their demographics can help provide more context towards mobility going into the target POIs outlined in this study.

## Results
1. Dynamic Kepler visualizations clearly show a decline in mobility during the lock-down period and a subsequent rise following the reopenings of our POIs.
2. The mobility to Balboa Park and Mission Beach shows a positive correlation to a younger demographic, which means that more people between the ages of 20 to 30 years frequented these destinations after the stay-at home orders were lifted.

A lot of data files containing the code for analysis and results couldn't be uploaded because of their size, since GitHub doesn't allow uploading files greater than 25 MB. If you are further interested in this ongoing research project, you can reach me at kratipatidar1996@gmail.com.
